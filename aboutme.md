This page contains information about my work as an astrophysicist until May 2023. 
I conducted research on galaxy formation, galaxy clusters, cosmic microwave background, and cosmology.

I got a Master’s degree in Astrophysics and Cosmology at the University of Bologna.
I did my Ph.D. at the Observatory of Paris (2018), with a thesis on “Stellar populations and scaling relations of galaxy clusters from their first epoch of assembly to the present”.
I worked as a research associate at the Cornell Center for Astrophysics and Planetary Science, and as a postdoctoral researcher at the Strasbourg Observatory - Astronomical Data Center.
I have been a member of the [Atacama Cosmology Telescope](https://act.princeton.edu/) collaboration.
I have been a support scientist for the [ESCAPE](https://projectescape.eu/) and [EOSC Future](https://eoscfuture.eu/) projects.

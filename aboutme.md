# subtitle: Welcome to my homepage!

I am an astrophysicist working at the [Observatoire astronomique de Strasbourg](https://astro.unistra.fr/en/).

I am a postdoc of the  [CDS](https://astro.unistra.fr/en/research/team-cds/) – Strasbourg Astronomical Data Center – and a support scientist for the [ESCAPE](https://projectescape.eu/) project.

I am interested in galaxy formation and evolution, galaxy clusters, cosmic microwave background and cosmology.

I worked as research associate at the Cornell Center for Astrophysics and Planetary Science. I did my Ph.D. at the Observatory of Paris (2018), with a thesis on “Stellar populations and scaling relations of galaxy clusters from their first epoch of assembly to the present”. Before that, I got a Master’s degree in Astrophysics and Cosmology at the University of Bologna.

I am Italian, currently based in Strasbourg, France.
